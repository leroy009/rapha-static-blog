# **Having a powerful prayer Life**

**Introduction** :

**John 10:10 NKJV** – _The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill and to destroy. I
have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more_ **_abundantly_**.

Abundantly in Greek is called **_Perissos_** (which is pronounced as **_Per-is-soss_** ); Strong word
#4053: A direct translation from Greek to English means Super-abundance, excessive,
overflowing, surplus, over and above, more than enough, profuse, extraordinary, above the
ordinary, more than sufficient.

The only way to activate an overflowing life is by seeking the perfect will of God. **Matthew
6:33 NKJV** – _But seek_ **_first_** _the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things
shall be added to you_.

In reference to our daily lives, it remains a challenge to prioritise. To be efficient, one must
plan and execute different tasks. Some of the tasks are more demanding than others.
(Covey, 1989) categorised priorities in terms of four quadrants as follows:

1. **Do** : Important and Urgent e.g., Being sensitive to the Holy Spirit informing you to
   pray, Prayer meetings, etc.
2. **Plan** : Important but not urgent e.g., Car maintenance and body exercises
3. **Delegate and/or Avoid** : Urgent but not important e.g., Posting birthday photos on
   social media etc.
4. **Eliminate** : Unimportant and not urgent e.g., reading newspaper and watching TV for
   hours

How do we seek the kingdom of God? Repentance - By accepting Jesus as our Lord and
Saviour, we simple enter a realm of faith. There are specific requirements for running a race
of faith (1 Cor. 9:24; 2 Tim.4:7). **Hebrews 12: 1-2 NKJV** – (1) Therefore we also, since we
are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside **every weight** , and **the sin**
which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, (2)
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before
Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the
throne of God

**Cloud of witnesses** – Heroes of Faith e.g., all Christians who died in the Lord.

**Weight** – everything that hinders your progress.

Apostle Theo wrote that the most important investment one can make for his or her future is
to know how to get answers for his/her prayers. In so doing, one must pay the price and
**learn how to pray correctly**. Christians pray amiss and often their prayers are not heard.
Why is so? Most believers are complacent to mediocrity and hardly study the bible. It is a
fact; many believers do not know how to pray.

In ( **Matthew 6: 5 – 15** ), Jesus had demonstrated the way Christians should pray. Jesus’
prayer model in Matthew reflected the manner we should pray.

1. Mat 6:5, Condemns fake and flashy prayer that attracts attention.

2. Mat 6:6, Encourages believers to pray in secret place in public places with the aim of
   being seen by people.
3. Mat 6.7, Condemns vain repetitions which is reference to an empty babbling for long
   hours.
4. Mat 6.8, Reminded Christians that God knows our needs before we ask. However,
   He still wants us to ask Him for all our needs as stated in **Mark 11:23 – 24.**
5. Mat 6:9, Jesus directs us to a personal intimate spiritual relationship with our Father
   in heaven. **Hallowed be** your name: establishes the principle of prayer on the
   precept of Worship.
6. Mat 6:10, Informs Christians to ask for the establishment of God’s rule on earth when
   they pray. This is a prayer of intercession.
7. Mat 6:11, Encourages believers to prayer for their physical needs. God wants us to
   ask Him for our needs **(Mark 11:23 -24).** He is delighted to give good things to those
   who ask Him **(Mat 7:11).** It is importantly to ask with godly motives as **mentioned in**
   **James 4:3** and asks according to God’s will **(1 John 5:14** ).
8. Mat 6:12, 14 & 15, Prayer for forgiveness is qualified by a readiness to forgive
   personal hurt. Stephen forgave those who stoned him ( **Acts 7:51 –60** )
9. Mat 6:13, Christians must always pray for deliverance and to be kept away from
   temptations. **Psalms 34:17, Psalms 107:6, 1 Peter 5- 8-9, and John 10: 9 -**

The model prayer is a directive for believers to know and apply when praying. It is important
to apply correct foundational scriptures when praying. A healing prayer cannot be prayed in
the same way as a consecration and/or petition prayer. The Bible had identified ten types of
prayers which we need to understand and apply as Christians to have a powerful prayer life.
These prayers are:

1. Prayer of Intercession
2. Prayer of Consecration
3. Prayer of Healing
4. Prayer of Petition,
5. Prayer of Thanksgiving
6. The Fervent prayer
7. Payer of Supplication
8. Praying in Tongues
9. Prayer of Faith
   10.Fasting prayer

**For today’s sermon, we will briefly look into all types of prayers and give at least an
example from the bible for each prayer**.

1. Intercession prayer:
   Intercession is a prayer on behalf of another and can therefore be defined as praying
   for others by the help of the Holy Spirit. God’s eagerness to help humanity was
   shown on the cross when Jesus died for our sins. It is important to note that God is
   limited by our prayers to help humanity. There is nothing accomplished concerning
   the realm of God, or in people’s lives, or on the earth without prayer. Whatever good
   things accomplished on earth; such things were accomplished through prayer when
   someone somewhere prayed. The Holy Spirit helps and teaches us how to pray.
   **Romans 8:26** - ‘ _Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not_
   _know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession_
   _for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.’_

```
When we do not know what do to and where to go, it is a perfect time to say, “Holy
Spirit help me.” In Galatian 8:27 , Paul said – “ Now He who searches the hearts
knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints
according to the will of God .”
```

```
Jesus is the greatest intercessor. He continues to intercede for us even though he is
in heaven ( Romans 8:34 ). He wants people to repent from their evil ways. God does
not want humankind to be condemned in hell forever but to receive an everlasting
life. Hence, God is looking for a man to stand in the gab for His kingdom to be
established fully on earth and for humankind to accept Jesus as their Lord and
saviour.
```

```
Daniel stood in the gab for Israelites by interceding as stated on Daniel 9:3 – “ Then I
set my face towards the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplication, with
fasting, sackcloth and ashes.” Believers, we have a duty to stand on the gab for
unbelievers.
```

2. Consecration prayer:
   I personally heard lots of Christians, Clergies and honourable men praying, “Let your
   will be done Lord but not mine while they are praying for a specific need and/or
   healing.” This becomes an incorrect application of the Word.

```
In Matthew 26:42 – Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying “O My
Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, your will be done.
Jesus made this prayer in agony of associating his death to sin. However, he knew
the scriptures will have to be fulfilled as prophesied by Prophet Isaiah who said on
verse 53:10 – Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put him to grief. When
You (God) make His (Jesus) Soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall
prolong His days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His Hand.
```

```
As believers, we can apply this prayer for example when we receive a promotion in
another city. It is important to first ask, if it is the will of God to move to another city.
```

3. Healing Prayer:
   When Jesus died on the Cross, he became the payment for our sins. Before
   breathing his last, he said it is finished. This means our healing was fully paid for on
   the cross. Prophet Isaiah prophesied in **Chapter 53 verse 4 and 5** – “ _Surely, He has_
   _borne our grief and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by_
   _God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our iniquities; the chastisement for our_
   _peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed_ .” Therefore, there is
   absolutely no need to say, “Lord! Let your will be done,” when praying for any sick
   person. As Christians, we ought to tell the sickness to go in the name of Jesus. Jesus
   gave us power to heal the sick.

```
Peter also bears witness to Prophet Isaiah’s prophesy in 1 Peter 2:24 – “ who Himself
bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for
righteousness – by whose stripes you were healed”.
```

```
Jesus cast out demon spirits with the Word and healed all who were sick ( Matthew
8: 16 – 17 ). As believers, we are given power to heal the sick.
```

4. Petition Prayer:
   It is important to note that this is a prayer we request God to give us our needs and
   as well as wants. It might be a job, finance, property, child, etc.
   **Mark 11: 23 – 24** , “ _For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, be_
   _removed and be cast into sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that_
   _those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore, I say to_
   _you whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you_
   _will have them_ .”
   **John 16: 23 – 24** , “ _And in that day you will ask me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to_
   _you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have_
   _asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full_ .”

```
The key point illustrated on the above scriptures are as follows:
a. You must believe you receive When you pray – right there and then.
b. If you do, Jesus said you shall have whatever you asked – that is some time
in the future.
c. In everyday language this means you must first believe you have got it before
actual delivery.
d. But if you do not believe you have received, you are never going to get it.
e. Do not ask for it repetitively. It is a sign of unbelief.
f. After asking, keep on thanking God for it specifying the time you received it
(the initial day of prayer).
```

5. Thanksgiving Prayer:
   Means adoration or praise. To thank or praise God is “to lift or extent one’s hands” in
   thanks to Him. David in **Psalm 95:2** said, “ _Let us come before His presence with_
   _thanksgiving; let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms_. Paul said in Colossians 4:
   that, “ _Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving_ .”

```
It is important for believers to give thanks to God. Thanksgiving shows appreciation
and acknowledges God who gives us power to reign as kings on earth.
```

6. Prayer of Worship:
   In **Matthew 15:9** , Jesus wants us to worship God whole-heartedly and further warns
   against worshiping insincerely. True worship requires that the mouth and the heart be
   together to avoid Jesus’ charge of hypocrisy. In **Genesis 22:5** , while Abraham was
   on Mount Moriah, he took Isaac his son and ordered his young men to stay behind
   because he wants to go further with his son to worship God.
7. The Fervent prayer:
   It is paramount important to pray whole-heartedly. It shows commitment, passion,
   and love. **James 5: 16 -17,** teaches us to “ _confess our trespasses to one another,_
   _and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a_
   _righteous man avails much. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed_
   _earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three years and six_
   _months_ .”

```
God’s power is often seen through committed believers. In ( Genesis 32:22-32) ,
Jacob wrestled with an angel until the breaking of the day, and he said, I will not let
you go unless you bless me. Jacob’s (Deceiver) name was changed to Israel (Prince
with God) because he struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.
```

8. Praying in Tongues (Pray fervently in Spirit):
   The foundation of all prayers is love. One can only stand in the gap because of
   obeying the commandment of love. Paul in **Romans 8:26 – 27** , said – “ _Likewise the_
   _Spirit helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we_
   _ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for is with groanings which cannot_
   _be uttered. Now he who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is,_
   _because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God_.

```
When we pray in Spirit, a natural mind idles and the Holy Spirit with his infinite
wisdom and knowledge enables an intercessory pray through us. At this point, we
intercede with the help of the Holy Spirit according to the will of God. We achieve this
level by resting our souls patiently in God and allow Him to move on and through us
as David said in Psalm 62:5 , “ My soul, wait silently for God alone, for my
expectations is from God .” Paul settles David’s experiences in Corinthians 14:14 ,
which says, “ For I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is
unfruitful.
```

```
Without love, even the gift of speaking in tongues is meaningless ( 1 Corinthians
13:1 )
```

9. Supplication prayer:
   Supplication is an intensity of sincerity in extended prayer not to gain merit by many
   words, but to fully transfer the burden of one’s soul into God’s hands.
   Paul lectures us to put the whole armour of God to stand against the forces of hell
   and put a battle-stand (pray) against satanic structure using the Word of God as our
   weapon. In **Ephesians 6:18** , Paul encourages believers to pray always with _all_
   _prayers and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance_
   _and supplications for all the saints.”_ Paul further gave believers an antidote of fear by
   writing a letter to Philippians while he was in prison to tell them not to be anxious for
   nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let their
   request be known to God.

```
10.Prayer of Faith (Praying with understanding):
Praying with understanding is when one uses his intellect to apply the Word of God
when praying ( 1 Corinthian 14:15 ). Paul refers this act as an edification of one
another. For example, if one blesses in Spirit, the receiver will not be thankful
because of lack understanding.
```

```
It is through the Word of God that the Holy Spirit awaken response of faith within us.
Rom 10:17 , so the faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. By
inclining, remembering, and applying the Word of God ( Proverbs 4:20 ), our faith in
God is awaken. Hebrews 11:1 , Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the
evidence of things not seen. In Mark 4: 35 – 40 , Jesus compare fear with faith and
refers fear as with no faith.
```

**Conclusion** :

The most important investment one can make for his future is knowing how to get answers
to his/her prayers. When everything else fails you in life, especially in a time of crisis,

knowing how to receive definite answers to our prayers may be a matter of life or death
