	"profile": "I have gained invaluable experience over the years as an accountant and tax practitioner in public and private sectors, as well as international Non-Profit Organisations. This knowledge will benefit both Rapha Wellness Centre (internal services) and its clients (external services), mainly focusing on value-addition and saving strategies in financial and tax aspects.How wise are we in managing the resources that God has given us? Can God trust us with more resources based on our current lifestyles? What short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans can we implement to become better stewards? The solutions to these questions, and more, are what makes Rapha Wellness Centreâ€™s financial advisory services wholesome.King Solomon, one of the wisest men to ever live, had this to say about being wise with our finances.",
