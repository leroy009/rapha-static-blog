	"profile": "I am highly passionate about empowering individuals to overcome challenges and achieve success in their personal journeys. I believe in providing guidance, support, and tools that enable individuals to navigate life's challenges with resilience and emerge as victorious individual. I also have a strong understanding of the importance of mental health. This passion has led me to pursue a career in counselling. </br> I have a pleasant personality and I am a very excellent listener thereby providing a safe and supportive place and environment for one to express their feelings. Having personal testimony on how God can heal broken hearts and make us whole again, I have witnessed peopleâ€™s lives being turned around for good and I strongly believe that with the right help and support, one can be able to overcome challenges, heal from their past and live a fulfilling life.",
